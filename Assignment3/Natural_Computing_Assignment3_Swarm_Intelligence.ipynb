Finding a solution depends on the objective function since, f(x) establishes a convex solution space which has less complexity of the search space. For instance, If the particle starts with the velocity which drawns the particle away from the optimum, personal best effect the particle and after some time particle will be moving to optimum point. When velocity is in the same direction with the optimum, personal best loose its influence. Then, velocity start to decrease. If the particle reaches to optimum before the velocity is zero, algorithm finds the optimum point. Particle will find the optimum for this trivial problem, because when w < 1, particles would be moving around the optimum. Then, after some steps velocity would be zero at the optimum.\n"

    "> ACO is inspired from the foraging behaviour of ants. How they find the closest food sources to their nests. They communicate with pheromones they leave. They leave their pheromone while moving. Also they tend to choose paths marked by strong pheromone concentrations. When ant finds a food source, it leaves pheromones according to some probability that may depend on the quantity and quality of the food during the return trip. Thus, quality food sources closest to the nest will have the path with more pheromone. \n",
    "However in this case without a tabu list, it is unavoidable that ants make cycles. Bottom of the picture, there are a lot of connected paths and this will cause a lot of pheromone accumulation and this result with most likely loopy paths. For the graph like this converging the minumum path is not trivial.\n",
    "To find the optimum solution an ant has to make number of correct desicions otherwise ant generates suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "There is a trade off between use of an easy but suboptimal path and searching the optimal path. \n",
    "In this case easy path would be that the ants takes the route trough the upper nodes and there is two optimal paths which are in the lower part of the graph and harder to find.\n",
    "We can avoid from cycles with high pheromone evaporation However, this will end up with not generating optimum solutions. Since this problem is relatively simple problem because of the large number of ants compared to the relatively small search space. After a lot of iterations algorithm find the fastest route in the densely connected part of graph which is down-up-right-down-up or down-down-rigt-up-up.\n"

    "> Ant is probabilisticaly choose the next node based on the amount of pheromone on the next node while it is searching for food exploring the space.\n",
    "For each ant we can keep a limited memory which is local pheromone this allows them to record their trip to their destination. When they reach their destination they can construct a way to back home. If they've passed over the same node twice they can eliminate the path in between those repeat nodes. Then they will retrace the steps they constructed based on the memory(local pheromone). On the way back to the nest ant will ignore the pheromone trails, follow the path that is costructed.\n",
    "When they are going back to the nest they will be applying pheromones to the ground(global pheromones) they will not apply to the global pheromones on the food searching step because that can cause loops.\n",

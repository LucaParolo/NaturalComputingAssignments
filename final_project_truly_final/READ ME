This is the code we have used for the project.
In each separate folder there is the program we used to evolve the agents as 
well as the results and the configuration file that Neat needs.

 We have also included the notebook 
we used to work with the data. The final_test folder contains a program
to run the winner of each scenarios and to normalized the data.
